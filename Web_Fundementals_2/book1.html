        He needn't ever have done so. You ought to know that. And so now you are
        one of these dashing Western heroes, and you ride and shoot and go into
        all kinds of dangers. That's different from the Washington life. You
        have been missed from the old crowd." The girl's eyes, fascinated, went
        back, widening a little, to rest upon the glittering handcuffs. "Don't
        you worry about them, miss," said the other man. "All marshals handcuff
        themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away. Mr. Easton
        knows his business."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Will we see you again soon in Washington?" asked the girl. "Not soon, I
        think," said Easton. "My butterfly days are over, I fear."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I love the West," said the girl irrelevantly. Her eyes were shining
        softly. She looked away out the car window. She began to speak truly and
        simply without the gloss of style and manner: "Mamma and I spent the
        summer in Denver. She went home a week ago because father was slightly
        ill. I could live and be happy in the West. I think the air here agrees
        with me. Money isn't everything. But people always misunderstand things
        and remain stupid--"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Say, Mr. Marshal," growled the glum-faced man. "This isn't quite fair.
        I'm needing a drink, and haven't had a smoke all day. Haven't you talked
        long enough? Take me in the smoker now, won't you? I'm half dead for a
        pipe." The bound travelers rose to their feet, Easton with the same slow
        smile on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I can't deny a petition for tobacco," he said, lightly. "It's the one
        friend of the unfortunate. Good-bye, Miss Fairchild. Duty calls, you
        know." He held out his hand for a farewell. "It's too bad you are not
        going East," she said, reclothing herself with manner and style. "But
        you must go on to Leavenworth, I suppose?"
      </p>
      <p>"Yes," said Easton, "I must go on to Leavenworth."</p>
      <p>
        The two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker. The two passengers in
        a seat near by had heard most of the conversation. Said one of them:</p>
        <p>"That marshal's a good sort of chap. Some of these Western fellows are
        all right."</p>
        <p>"Pretty young to hold an office like that, isn't he?" asked
        the other.</p>
      <p> "Young!" exclaimed the first speaker, "why--Oh! didn't you
        catch on? Say--did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to
        his right hand?"
