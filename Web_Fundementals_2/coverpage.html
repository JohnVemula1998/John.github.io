      O. Henry was the pen name of William Sydney Porter, an American short
      story writer who is known for his tales about the life of ordinary people,
      especially in New York. His stories generally expressed the effect of
      coincidence on character through humour, grim or irony. Above anything
      else, he is known for his surprise endings. Once his trademark, it finally
      cost him critical favour.
